# Grok3 API

Grok3 is cool, smart, and useful, but there is no official API available. This is an **unofficial Python client** for interacting with the Grok 3 API. It leverages cookies from browser requests to authenticate and access the API endpoints.

---

## Setup

Follow these steps to get started with the Grok3 API client.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mem0ai/grok3-api.git
```

### 2. Install the Package
Navigate to the project directory, create a virtual environment, and install the package:

```
cd grok3-api
virtualenv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
pip install .
```

### 3. Obtain Cookie Values

To use this client, you need to extract authentication cookies from a browser session:

* Open grok.com in your browser.
* Log in if you aren't already logged in.
* Open the browser's developer tools (e.g., F12 or right-click > Inspect).
* Go to the "Network" tab and filter for requests containing the new-chat endpoint (e.g., https://grok.com/rest/app-chat/conversations/new).
* Right-click the request, select "Copy as cURL," and paste it somewhere.
From the curl command, extract the following cookie values from the -H 'cookie: ...' header:
    * x-anonuserid
    * x-challenge
    * x-signature
    * sso
    * sso-rw

Example cookie string from a curl command:
```
-H 'cookie: x-anonuserid=ffdd32e1; x-challenge=TkC4D...; x-signature=fJ0U00...; sso=eyJhbGci...; sso-rw=eyJhbGci...'
```

### 4. Use the Client

Pass the extracted cookie values to the GrokClient and send a message:

```
from grok_client import GrokClient

# Your cookie values
cookies = {
    "x-anonuserid": "ffdd32e1",
    "x-challenge": "TkC4D..",
    "x-signature": "fJ0...",
    "sso": "ey...",
    "sso-rw": "ey..."
}

# Initialize the client
client = GrokClient(cookies)

# Send a message and get response
response = client.send_message("write a poem")
print(response)
```

### 5. Optional: Add Memory with Mem0

If you want Grok to remember conversations, you can integrate it with Mem0. Mem0 provides a memory layer for AI applications.

#### 5.1 Install Mem0

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

#### 5.2 Add & Retrieve Memory

```
from mem0 import Memory

memory = Memory()

# for user alice
result = memory.add("I like to take long walks on weekends.", user_id="alice")

# Retrieve memories
related_memories = memory.search(, user_id="alice")
print(related_memories)
```
