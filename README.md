Thomas is a live AI agent that offers various services. The architecture is based on a client-server model, where Thomas is the client and various services are the servers.

Thomas can offer the following services:

* Scrape LinkedIn job postings every day
* Make job posting response schema
* Check out job descriptions
* Tokenize job descriptions
* Search most popular job descriptions

Thomas can also integrate with various social media platforms and scrape data from them. Additionally, Thomas can integrate with SAP, news, weather, and geopolitical risk services.

Thomas can also be used to display routes on a map, given entry points.

Thomas can also be used to send risk alerts and notifications. For example, when do you want to reroute shipments? When do you want to relocate inventory?

The architecture of Thomas is based on a client-server model. The client is the user interface, and the server is the AI agent. The user interface sends a query to the AI agent, and the AI agent responds with a text result and a random result (between phone number, map, mp3, mp4, etc).
